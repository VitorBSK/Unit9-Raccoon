# Unit09 Docs Site

A small documentation site for the Unit09 project, built with Next.js. It is
intended to be deployed as a static site or behind a simple Node process.

## Sections

- Intro — high-level overview of Unit09
- Getting started — CLI and first repo
- Workflow — how Unit09 observes, analyzes, decomposes, generates, and syncs
- Modules — working with generated modules
- Forks — understanding Unit09 forks
- API — HTTP integration surface

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can customize the content by editing the markdown strings in
\`src/pages/*.tsx\` or by replacing the markdown renderer with a richer
implementation.
